I am currently an M.S. Electrical Engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder, I am focusing my coursework and research in Control Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Applied Mathematics, and Mechanical Engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder. In addition to my degrees, I also obtained certificates in Engineering Leadership and Global Engineering.

My research interests are in: hybrid dynamical systems, applied machine learning, optimization, statistics, autonomy, and social engineering.

Besides my academic experience I have intern experience at Tesla, Endress+Hauser, and ECN Automation. During my downtime I normally play with electronics (DIY), lately with TinyML projects.
